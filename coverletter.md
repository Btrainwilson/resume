Give them something high on their goal hierarchy

Dear OpenAI Hiring Manager,

I am pleased to express my interest in the Research Scientist position at OpenAI. Being at the intersection of industry and academic research like OpenAI, I seek your advice. I've spent the last three years leading a team of machine learning researchers to help labs like those at OpenAI. Our lab develops ethical AI for the future of academia and industry focused on experimental physics and engineering applications. We work on physics-inspired deep-learning models and write open-source software for the community to do the same. Specifically, we are working on deep-learning for measurement speed-up and verification of semiconductors, quantum device design for improving quantum algorithms, quantum-enhanced sampling algorithms for material design in renewable energy, CUDA accelerated physics simulations, custom paper writing software with large language models, and computer vision for experimental physics. I've largely been successful at growing and leading this team, having published several preprints with high-impact publications on the way and presented at many conferences. I am proud of my mentees and their contributions and I know I can replicate this growth in OpenAI's lab as well. In this leadership role, I looked to the future of AI research and my own career, learning to act as a good scientist by securing funding, resources, and career opportunities for my group's research, teaching my mentees how to conduct research from start to finish and giving them actionable research steps to accomplish the lab's goals, and allowing them autonomy to explore new ideas in physics inspired machine learning. Combined with mentorship responsibilities at Purdue and the Quantum Science Center (QSC), this leadership experience has equipped me for the next stage of my career as a scientist and I am excited to take that step at OpenAI. I am confident that I can offer a wide variety of collaborations and unique expertise for OpenAI's future work.


Thank you for considering my application. The opportunity to synergize with OpenAI renowned research community greatly excites me.

Warm regards,

Blake Wilson
