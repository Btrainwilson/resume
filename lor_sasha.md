Dear <committee>,

  <br>

I am delighted to recommend Blake Wilson for the [object]. I lead the workforce development of Graduate students and Postdoctoral fellows at the Quantum Science Center and have over 20 years of experience leading quantum optics and materials research. I have seen several graduate students become renowned scientists at top institutions, but I have never seen a graduate student like Blake successfully leading a group of so many students developing high-impact and foundational AI algorithms for experimental physics.  

For five years, I've mentored Blake in leading our machine learning team, 
On the research front, Blake is a versatile researcher, able to tackle problems 

our collaboration with QuEra Computing, steered by esteemed Harvard and MIT professors, highlights Blake's unparalleled expertise in quantum engineering. Blake’s initiative in this domain promises to set an exceptional precedent for future endeavors.

Beyond his technical capabilities, what also distinguishes Blake is his ability to communicate and connect. He's an outstanding public speaker, able to articulate complex ideas with clarity and charm. This, combined with his caring nature, makes him a beloved figure within the Purdue community. 

Furthermore, Blake is a consummate mentor. His proactive approach ensures his students are not only equipped with knowledge but also with opportunities. The initiatives he’s led, from fireside chats with global scientific leaders to the inclusive QSC Summer School, have paved pathways for many. His commitment to diversity and representation, as seen in events like the Black in Physics career fair, is commendable.


Under my guidance, Blake has built a research group rivaling the size of those led by established faculty members. Currently, he directs four major research projects, mentoring students with the dedication and expertise typical of a seasoned professor. His adeptness in securing research funding and advocating for student opportunities stands out. The leadership roles he’s embraced, from a machine learning team to key positions within the Quantum Science Center as the Postdoctoral and Graduate student association lead, showcase his unyielding commitment to his peers and mentees. He has received numerous recommendations and praises from them, taughting him as being a focused and influential mentor in their lives. His nurturing leadership style has garnered so much respect that graduate students often mistakenly address him as "Professor" before realizing he is a Ph.D. student — a testament to his standing within the academic circle.

He has admirably undertaken roles often reserved for seasoned professionals: organizing the Quantum Summer School annually, advocating for career opportunities for his students through recommendations and networking, spearheading workforce development within postdoctoral and graduate student associations, securing funding through grant writing, negotiating resource purchases, and publishing in esteemed venues. 


Looking ahead, Blake's aspirations for a professorship and his ongoing commitment as a mentor and community leader are evident. His publication record is impressive and will include several high-impact additions by his graduation. Above all, he truly embodies the values of Purdue University: productivity, creativity, and a genuine collaborative spirit.

In conclusion, I wholeheartedly endorse Blake Wilson for the [object]. Should you require additional insights into his credentials or experience, please feel free to contact me.
