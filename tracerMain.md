**Statement of Purpose**
</div>

 &nbsp;&nbsp; Quantum computers hold incredible promise for science and humanity. However, harnessing their computational efficiency for practical engineering problems has been incredibly challenging. 
The current generation of quantum computers offer too few qubits and are too noisy to map real-world engineering algorithms directly into the computer. In 2021, we took the first step by demonstrating a machine learning algorithm that faithfully circumvents the noise and low-qubit issues by compressing the engineering problem onto the quantum computer's optimization space. We applied our algorithm to identify optimal material designs and achieved a time-to-solution ratio better than any classical algorithm. However, our solution left open many areas to consider before finally declaring this problem solved.  

 &nbsp;&nbsp; In 2022, we began collaborating with QuEra Computing, a multi-million dollar startup with the largest and least noisy quantum simulator in the world. We've improved our previous algorithm by incorporating more advanced sampling techniques that demonstrate quantum advantage. We also have preliminary proof-of-concept results for the design of an optical device, which is slated for incorporation into the newest generation of their machine. To complete this research and benefit from the expertise of world-renowned professors, I am seeking funding to revisit Harvard University, MIT, and QuEra Computing. This travel will be split into three parts. The first part will be to work closely with their engineering team while we collect data and to focus exclusively on writing results in a final paper. QuEra's team has published numerous papers in Nature and Science and we feel this paper will be a candidate to be published alongside them. However, to ensure that the paper meets the quality required by QuEra and the editors at these prestigious journals, I will need focused mentorship. The second and third visits will be to learn how to integrate the metalens design into their machine after we fabricate the design at Purdue along with presenting to other researchers at Harvard and MIT, develop deeper research relationships with Professors Mikhail Lukin, Susanne Yelin, and Vladin Vuletic, and to receive mentorship from them regarding an academic career at Harvard and MIT. As a follow up to our current work, we also want to begin a research collaboration with Robert Huang, a visiting researcher in Professor Lukin's group, to prove quantum advantage for QuEra's quantum simulator. With your support, I aim to publish  a potentially landmark paper in the field, further bolstering my prospects as a future faculty member through invaluable mentorship at Harvard, MIT and QuEra. Thank you for your consideration and I look forward to hearing from you.

Sincerely,

Dear TRACER Committee,

  <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; It gives me great pleasure to recommend Blake Wilson for the TRACER grant. Blake is poised for a successful career as a faculty member and his significant impact on Purdue University in his 8 year tenure is undeniable. He has been an exceptionally successful research assistant in my group for the past four years.  Blake is developing many skills that are crucial to becoming a faculty member and I have no doubt that the TRACER Grant will be a stepping stone to his long and fruitful career. He's taken on several responsibilities that are beyond that of a graduate student, including organizing the annual Quantum Summer School workshop every May, leading the workforce development of postdoctoral and graduate student associations, publishing in top venues and journals, working at premier institutions, such as Harvard University, QuEra Computing, and the Quantum Science Center, and leading a machine learning team of 8 undergraduate students and 5 graduate students in research. His research is co-advised by myself, Prof. Sabre Kais, Prof. Vladimir Shalaev, and Prof. Alexander Kildishev. 

&nbsp;&nbsp; With my oversight, he's already grown a research group larger than many beginning faculty members. At the moment, he is leading four major research projects and delegating research goals and objectives to undergraduate students just like a professor leading a lab. Additionally, he's secured research funding for himself and his undergraduate students, advocated for greater opportunities for them, and earned the responsibility to lead three efforts within our groups, a machine learning research team, a set of research collaborations within the Elmore Center, and the entire Postdoctoral and Graduate Student Association in the Quantum Science Center at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. Within all these leadership positions, he is always putting his team before himself, often spending weekends and late nights teaching others how to prepare their presentations, proposals, and publications. Because of his encouragement, guidance, and letters of recommendation, his students and peers have won numerous awards, earned prestigious internships, and secured positions in some of the world's top graduate programs- a testament to his faculty member mindset.  Blake’s charisma, confidence, and connections put him in meetings with some of the world’s leading scientists on a regular basis. He is constantly passing these same opportunities forward to his mentees to network and collaborate with these same scientists. As the team lead for the Postdoctoral and Graduate Student Association for the QSC, Blake empowered a team of ten postdoctoral researchers and graduate students to provide career development opportunities to over sixty postdocs and graduate students in the Quantum Science Center. He and his team organized biweekly fireside chats and open discussion for undergraduate and graduate students. The chats give an opportunity for scientists from Harvard, IBM, Microsoft, Google, etc., to introduce their work to students and engage in an open discussion about their career, life advice, and research passions. Outside of these fireside chats, Blake and his team also played an integral role in the QSC Summer School, an annual week-long conference for students across Purdue and the QSC where they have an opportunity to present their research to the quantum information science community, network with quantum industry leaders, and setup future collaborations with quantum scientists around the world. Additionally, he and his team participate in diversity and inclusion events such as the Black in Physics career fair to provide opportunities in quantum information science for underrepresented groups. 

&nbsp;&nbsp; Blake's impact extends far beyond his role as a mentor. He is also an incredible researcher which is why I was eager to encourage Blake's collaboration with QuEra Computing. Our collaborator Mikhail Lukin is a long-time friend and colleague. His company's research into quantum machine learning algorithms aligns incredibly well with the efforts in our group. Our group focuses on applying machine learning and quantum algorithms to the improvement of photonic devices. Continuing the groundbreaking work that Blake started in 2021, we are heavily invested in Blake's work with QuEra. The preliminary data Blake and the QuEra team have collected show a lot of promise for the impact of their work and we believe this will be a strong foundation for his career as a faculty member. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking to the future, Blake is set on securing a professorship and further establishing himself as a mentor and community leader. Outside of his mentoring abilities, Blake is one of the top graduate researchers at Purdue, projecting to publish over 10 publications in several multidisciplinary projects before earning his Ph.D. At first glance, he is often mistaken for being a professor because of his confident verbal communication skills, charisma, and big ideas. Moreover, Blake exemplifies Purdue University's values. He is incredibly productive, self-motivated, creative, and a joy to work with. I wholeheartedly recommend him for the TRACER grant without any reservations! If you have further questions regarding Blake Wilson’s credentials or experience, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Dear TRACER Grant Committee,  

</br>

 &nbsp;&nbsp; I am pleased to recommend Blake Wilson for the TRACER grant to collaborate with our algorithms and applications team at QuEra Computing. Blake was an invaluable research consultant with our team in 2022 and we want to invite him back for continued mentorship and research opportunities. We are fully committed to Blake's success in academia as a future faculty member and we can provide several opportunities for him to network with Harvard and MIT professors to seek a postdoctoral opportunity in Boston.

&nbsp;&nbsp; While he was here, he regularly took advantage of the numerous workshops and conferences hosted at Harvard and MIT to network with professors and other researchers. His work is regularly discussed with the faculty that serve on our board and we can provide exclusive opportunities to present his work to our professors. We also offer one-on-one mentorship through our experienced algorithms team, some who have held previous professorship positions, and can guide Blake to prepare for the next stage in his career.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;Our company remains at the forefront of academic research in quantum machine learning algorithms and Blake's expertise in these algorithms is crucial to our research success. Blake is a very hardworking, ambitious, and gifted scientist who will excel at an academic career. Upon acceptance, we will host Blake periodically throughout the year in multi-week periods. Initially, we will mentor Blake in publishing results from our current collaborative research into a top journal. Additionally, we will give him opportunities to present our work to professors at Harvard, MIT, and other universities in the Boston area. We would also like to begin a new project with Blake to study the theoretical limitation of quantum machine learning on our machine. Our work in collaboration with Blake will accelerate his career and I have no doubt he will be one of the finest faculty members at any institution. Thank you for your consideration for this prestigious opportunity.

##  Relevant Experience

### **Research Consultant | QuEra Computing, Cambridge, MA | 2022 – Present**

- Developing generative model applications and Bayesian optimization for Rydberg atom quantum computer.
- Designing and testing unsupervised geometric neural networks for mapping metric spaces with applications in information geometry.
- Applying machine learning for the optimization of a metalens for the trapping of Rydberg atoms.
- Proved that optimization of pseudo-Boolean surrogate functions constructed by the low-degree algorithm cannot exceed the sampled set.

### **Research Assistant | Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN | 2016 – Present**

- Proved the undecidability of simulation properties between a simulation and its simulator. These undecidability results prove that the simulation hypothesis is undecidable, quantum mechanics can be simulated by a classical computer using special relativistic simulation properties, and artificial intelligence cannot prove it is simulated [1].
- Developed a sampling algorithm for designing the topology of nanophotonic devices by sampling the latent space of a variational autoencoder via a factorization machine surrogate model. The ML algorithm can generate 500 thermal emitter designs in 30 minutes while state of the art, non-ML based algorithms take several hours to days for similar efficiencies. [2]
- Created a new vertex-separator that generalizes the Catalan Numbers and proved its generating function in infinite -ary trees. [5]
- Built and integrated scientific packages (S4, D-Wave Leap, Quantum Monte-Carlo) with Cloud API's, Python, MATLAB, and C/C++ for implementing my team's research projects.
