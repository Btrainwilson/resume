#### Project Contributions
- Authored 6 seminal papers as the lead contributor, paving the way for significant advancements in quantum-enhanced optimization for engineers, with 2 publications in high-impact venues: Applied Physics Reviews and the American Controls Conference. We succesffully presented and leveraged this research to secure 4 new research collaborations with Harvard, QuEra Computing, and Microsoft, for which I lead a team of 10+ researchers to show first demonstration of quantum bootstrapping which will allow for quantum computers to improve themselves asymptotically faster than classical computers.
- Developed scientific software to facilitate my team's productivity in machine learning assisted measurements, leading to: a 53,000x speed-up in semantic segmentation of plasmonic systems, 12x speed-up and 50\% accuracy improvement in plasmonic material verification with applications in semiconductor device security. These speed-ups make the gold nanoparticles a robust physical unclonable function for securing the semiconductor industry against adversarial intent.  
- First demonstration of quantum improvement over classical optimization algorithms for a real-world optimization task, meta-optical device design of diffraction gratings and thermophotovoltaic cells, thereby demonstrating that quantum annealers are viable optimizers for real-world engineering problems with higher efficiency than standard classical methods. 

#### Research and Analysis
- Designed statistical algorithms for muti-UAV routing problems, random plasmonic physical unclonable functions, and Markov chain horizon problems for risk aware package delivery. Our algorithms assist in securing drones and semiconductor devices in risky environments during search and rescue, package delivery, and sensitive information collection. 
- Our work is leading to a patent for a technology that protects the semiconductor industry against malicious tampering of chips.

### **Graduate Software Engineering Intern | Arm, Austin, TX | Summer 2019**
- Rebuilt 2 ARMv8 intruction verification methods, and the random number generation system in ARM's verification suite, Raven, to reduce the complexity of debugging for customers. We immediately received positive feedback from customers on improving engineer workflow and architecture test reproducability.
- Improved the Chi-Square distribution of ARM's software verification suite random number generation from 0.2 to 0.5 by rebuilding the seed generation. This led to engineers reproducing instruction tests by conditioning on a single seed.
