# Blake Wilson          
*Ph.D. Student at Purdue University*

*Research Consultant at QuEra Computing*  

#

I learned early on that good science is done with a good team. Over the past five years, I've been building the NanoML team, a group of graduate and undergraduate students developing machine learning and quantum computing algorithms for quantum machine learning, quantum optics, and fundamental physics. In the coming months, we will be publishing on quantum enhanced Markov Chain Monte Carlo for optimization, designing meta-lenses for optical trapping of Rydberg atoms and the demonstration of generative adversarial modeling for tampering detection in cryptographic plasmonic systems. Throughout the process of leading this team, I've learned how to write funding proposals, coordinate several researchers onto projects, and lead other researchers through the research process. Our team has won numerous resarch fellowships, published in conferences, earned prestigious internships, planned and executed Quantum Science Center wide summer schools and were accepted into top Ph.D. programs. I'm incredibly proud of our work together and the legacy I will be leaving behind at Purdue University.

Now, I look forward to a new research path and opportunities to continue to build research teams. I am actively working on quantum inspired machine learning optimization algorithms with applications in quantum optics. However, my interests are in optimization algorithm analysis, bayesian modeling, quantum machine learning, and statistical physics. I am looking for full-time opportunity to continue mentoring new students, explore new ideas at the intersection of physics and machine learning, and work on exciting and groundbreaking ideas in machine learning and physics.

### **Research Assistant | Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN | 2016 – Current**

- Developed a sampling algorithm for designing the topology of nanophotonic devices by sampling the latent space of a variational autoencoder via a factorization machine surrogate model. The ML algorithm can generate 500 thermal emitter designs in 30 minutes while state of the art, non-ML based algorithms take several hours to days for similar efficiencies. [2]

- Hosted monthly fireside chats with Purdue ECE alumni to give high school and undergraduate students opportunities to learn from successful alumni.

### System-On-Chip Software Team Lead | Purdue University SOC Team | 2018 – 2019

- Tasked to lead a team to generate bootup code and a ROM module in 3 months for running startup tests in a custom 90nm RISCV System-on-Chip (SOC) fabricated at MIT Lincoln Labs[,](https://engineering.purdue.edu/SoC-Team/about/system-on-chips)[the AFTx04](https://engineering.purdue.edu/SoC-Team/about/system-on-chips)[.](https://engineering.purdue.edu/SoC-Team/about/system-on-chips)
- Developed a Python tool to compile C code into RISCV machine code and onboard the machine code into a Verilog ROM module compatible with the SOC protocols.
- After finishing the ROM module early, I fixed critical bugs in the system-on-chip from source code to netlist level. This work directly led to the team's first completely functional SOC and led to future research projects, including integrated machine learning projects, and more funding for the next version of the chip.
- Developed test vectors for verifying the SOC with NSWC Crane and MIT-Lincoln Lab engineers.
