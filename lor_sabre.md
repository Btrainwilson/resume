Dear Committee,

<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;I am writing to wholeheartedly endorse Blake Wilson for [object]. I have over 30 years experience directing quantum research with institutions such as Harvard, the NSF, and Purdue. While his work in mentorship, team-management, and workforce development are substantial; I will speak to Blake's character and my experiences working withhis in technical research. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the past five years, Blake has successfully accomplished a task that few know how to even approach, developing useful quantum algorithms for machine learning and engineering. His deep background in computer engineering, physics, theoretical computer science and algorithms give him a unique perspective to combine these fields at their cross-section and deliver exciting, high-impact research. His first project under my guidance was to demonstrate a quantum-enhanced machine learning algorithm for optimizing nanophotonics with my esteemed colleagues Prof. Alexandra Boltasseva, Prof. Vladimir Shalaev and Prof. Alexander Kildishev. Due to Blake's ingenius understanding of quantum algorithms, machine learning and computational electromagnetics, this project was the world's first demonstration of quantum-enhanced sampling for optimizing practical engineering problems in nanophotonics. His professionalism, efficiency, and forward-thinking approach left a lasting impression on all of us. As such, we strongly supported his internship with QuEra Computing at Harvard and MIT because we believed Blake is one of the best Purdue has to offer. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;Diving into the depths of interdisciplinary work, Blake consistently exhibits a penchant for innovative thinking. A notable instance of this was in 2022, when he ingeniously conceptualized a method to mask the computational complexity of simulating quantum mechanics via special relativity, offering a fresh perspective on theoretical quantum computing. Our collaborative work on this idea made it through the first round of editorial review with Nature Communications, but we agreed to revisit the work to expand its impact to understanding black holes and general relativity with a future planned submission. It's evident to all of his colleagues and mentors that Blake is not just a proficient engineer, but also an incredible theorist, providing insights into fundamental physics and machine learning through theoretical computer science. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Blake Wilson epitomizes the best qualities one seeks in both a researcher and a human being. His blend of technical mastery, visionary thinking, and genuine compassion positions him as a valuable asset to any institution. With full confidence, I vouch for Blake's continued excellence and success in any endeavor he chooses to pursue.
