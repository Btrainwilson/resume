I love leading students to succeed in research and developing new connections between mathematics, physics, and computer science. I've been able to reach hundreds of new researchers through the Quantum Science Center at Oak Ridge National Lab and the ECE department at Purdue University. My current research is focused on the development of new information geometry inspired neural networks, Bayesian quantum optimization on neutral atoms, designing meta-lenses for optical trapping of Rydberg atoms and the demonstration of generative adversarial modeling for tampering detection in cryptographic plasmonic systems.

##  Relevant Experience

### **Research Consultant | QuEra Computing, Cambridge, MA | 2022 – Current**

- Developing generative model applications and Bayesian optimization for Rydberg atom quantum computer.
- Designing and testing unsupervised geometric neural networks for mapping metric spaces with applications in information geometry.
- Applying machine learning for the optimization of a hyperbolic metalens for the trapping of Rydberg atoms.
- Proved that optimization of pseudo-Boolean surrogate functions constructed by the low-degree algorithm cannot exceed the sampled set.

### **Research Assistant | Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN | 2016 – Current**

- Proved the undecidability of simulation properties between a simulation and its simulator. These undecidability results prove that the simulation hypothesis is undecidable, quantum mechanics can be simulated by a classical computer using special relativistic simulation properties, and artificial intelligence cannot prove it is simulated [1].
- Developed a sampling algorithm for designing the topology of nanophotonic devices by sampling the latent space of a variational autoencoder via a factorization machine surrogate model. The ML algorithm can generate 500 thermal emitter designs in 30 minutes while state of the art, non-ML based algorithms take several hours to days for similar efficiencies. [2]
- Created a new vertex-separator that generalizes the Catalan Numbers and proved its generating function in infinite $\Delta$-ary trees. [5]
- Built and integrated scientific packages (S4, D-Wave Leap, Quantum Monte-Carlo) with Cloud API's, Python, MATLAB, and C/C++ for implementing my team's research projects.

### **Graduate Software Engineering Intern | Arm, Austin, TX | Summer 2019**

- Improved ARMv8 verification self-test reproducibility and the Chi-Square distribution of ARM's software verification suite RNG from 0.2 to 0.5 by restructuring the RNG seeding.
- Wrote Python scripts to compare the coverage of ARMv8 self-tests generated by various C++ RNG's.
- Rebuilt 2 ARMv8 self-test directives to reduce the complexity of debug self-tests.

- Planned and executed the [2nd Annual QSC Summer School](https://www.ornl.gov/news/quantum-science-center-concludes-second-annual-summer-school-style) at Purdue University, a four day quantum conference with over 120 participants and several distinguished speakers from academia, industry, and national labs.

### Nanophotonics Machine Learning Lab | Team Lead | 2021 - Current

- Lead a team of graduate researchers to develop machine learning algorithms for improving applications in nanophotonics, e.g., meta-optics design, fabrication, characterization and measurement.
- Developed PyExLab and PyExML python packages to assist teammates with designing machine learning experiments.

### Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship | Graduate Mentor | Summer 2020

- Mentored a group of 20 undergraduate researchers to execute a research project from start to finish and guided their career development throughout the summer.
- Due to the overtime I spent mentoring students, my group won the most awards during the SURF 2020 symposium and several students went on to become Ph.D. students at top universities like Cornell, Johns Hopkins, Purdue University, etc., and publish their work in top journals and conferences.

- Developed a Python tool to compile C code into RISCV machine code and onboard the machine code into a Verilog ROM module compatible with the SOC protocols.
- After finishing the ROM module early, I fixed critical bugs in the system-on-chip from source code to netlist level. This work directly led to the team's first completely functional SOC and led to future research projects, including integrated machine learning projects, and more funding for the next version of the chip.
- Developed test vectors for verifying the SOC with NSWC Crane and MIT-Lincoln Lab engineers.
